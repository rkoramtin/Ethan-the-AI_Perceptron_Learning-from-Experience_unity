# Ethan-the-AI-Perceptron-Learning-from-Experience_unity
In this project we train an artificial character named Ethan To dodge the red balls

A perceptron is the the simplest form of a neural network. A perceptron takes inputs, processes them with it's own function and then makes the decision to what to do.
Here we use a perceptron as an artificial character's brain and he is trained to dodge the RED Balls.
